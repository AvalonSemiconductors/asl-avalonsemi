This is a mirror of Alfred Arnold's "The Macroassembler AS". It is generated
from the source drops at the source repository. No more detailed revision history
(say CVS) is available as of this writing.

For downloading, use repo/download.sh on the upstream branch. Then rebase the master
branch onto it.

I accept pull requests to the master branch, the upstream branch will remain pristine.
